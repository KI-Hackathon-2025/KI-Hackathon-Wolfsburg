# üöÄ KI-Hackathon-2025

Repository for KI Hackathon - An AI-powered personal information management and form filling assistant.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project aims to simplify personal information management and form filling through AI assistance. Users can upload their personal information through various formats, ask questions about processed data, and have forms automatically filled out based on their stored information.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- **Frontend**: React-based UI with TypeScript
  - User interface components
  - API integration
  - Form visualization
- **Backend**: FastAPI Python backend
  - Data processing modules
  - AI agent integration
  - Document handling
  - Data storage
  - **Data** 
    - Scraped Data: Background knowledge from public sources
    - User Data: Securely stored personal information
- `README.md`: Project documentation

## üñ•Ô∏è How to run frontend

1. Run `cd frontend` to move to frontend directory
2. Run `npm install` to **install** the required packages
3. Run `npm run dev` to **start** the development server (we will use this for now)
4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173` to view the application

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to run backend

1. Run `cd backend` to move to backend directory
2. Run `python3 -m venv .venv` to **create** a virtual environment
3. Run `source .venv/bin/activate` to **activate** the virtual environment
4. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to **install** the required packages to the virtual environment
5. Run `uvicorn main:app --reload` to **start** the backend server
6. The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`
7. Access API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`

## üêç Python Virtual Environment tips

### üîã Virtual Environment Activation

- To **activate** the virtual environment, run `source .venv/bin/activate`
- To **deactivate** the virtual environment, run `deactivate`
- To **check** if the virtual environment is activated, run `which python3` and it should show the path to the virtual environment

### üì¶ Installing packages

- Before installing packages, MAKE SURE the virtual environment is **activated**
- To **install** packages, run `pip install <package-name>`
- To **save** the installed packages to `requirements.txt`, run `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
  - `requirements.txt` is a file that contains all the packages installed (like `package.json` in Node.js)
